#  C++ Pool 💻

The **C++ Pool** is an intensive C++ training designed to teach students the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C++ programming. 🚀

It covers various topics such as **object-oriented programming**, **memory management**, **templates** and **inheritance**.

The objective of this project is to develop a wide range of versatile skills in C++.

## Features 📋
- **Object-oriented programming:** understand and implement classes, inheritance and polymorphism
- **Memory management:** Learn dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C++
- **Templates and STL:** Use C++ templates and the Standard Template Library for efficient and flexible code

## Objectives 🎯
1. Develop a strong foundation in C++ programming
2. Master advanced C++ features and concepts
3. Build versatile and efficient C++ applications
